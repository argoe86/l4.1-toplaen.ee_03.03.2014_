#1 [FIXED 2011.02.24] If LOCAL_FILES (in conf.php) is set to true and uploaded digidoc file contains datafiles with names that contain special 
Estonian chars "צ", "ה", "", "ץ" etc, then xml_parser returns error and $ddoc->getDigiDoc(LOCAL_FILES) in index.php returns 
digidoc file in its original form, not hashcoded, as it should. In this case ddservice sample application acts as if LOCAL_FILES
was set to false.

#2 No singing application should let the user sign one document more than once using the same token (ID-card, Digi-ID, Mobile-ID).

#3 ddservice application allows signing even if there are no datafiles in the digidoc container - that's pointless to create such digidoc files.

#4 symbols ‏ and נ in datafile name or digidoc container name are not handled correctly - they are replaced as follows: ‏->zh and נ->sh

#5 Failed to sign using the following combination: WinXP sp2, old ID-card software, Chrome 9/Safari 5.0.3, SignatureApplet 0.17 
(message "sertifikaate ei leitud")

#6 MacOSX 10.5.8, new ID-card software, Mozilla 3.6.13, failed to add file named צהץ‏נ.rtf to digidoc container

#7 MacOSX 10.5.8, new ID-card software, Safari 5.0.3, when uploading file named צהץ.rtfd, then in the digidoc container the uploaded
filed appeared as צהץ.rtfd.zip (it's because of the special chars צהץ).
